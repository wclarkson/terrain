Fractal Terrain Generation in Processing
Started: January 6, 2012

This was my first attempt at generating random terrain using a 1-dimensional
version of the diamond-square algorithm. To illustrate the iterative steps of
the algorithm, moving the mouse left and right sets the number of iterations
performed. Clicking the mouse sets a new random seed.
