2D Fractal Terrain Generation in Processing
Started: January 6, 2012

This sketch builds on the original 1D version, and implements the full
diamond-square algorithm. The terrain is stored in a 2D array of floats, and
rendered using Processing's internal 3D renderer. I also added the ability to
export a 3D model of the terrain in STL format, which is pretty straightforward
to output. The terrain map can also be drawn as a 2D grayscale heightmap.

The following resources were important in understanding the algorithm:
