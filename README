Experiments in Fractal Terrain Generation
January, 2012

Over winter break I became interested in how relatively simple algorithms can
be used to generate complex and rather realistic terrain. This article, in
particular, sparked my interest:

http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~amitp/game-programming/polygon-map-generation/

I started with a simple Ruby program to generate 1D terrain data and ended up
with a Processing sketch capable of rendering a passable 3D model of a 2D
heightmap, as well as exporting an STL of the terrain.
