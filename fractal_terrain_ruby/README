1D Fractal Terrain Generation in Ruby
Started: January 5, 2012

This was my first attempt at a 1D version of a random subdivision algorithm for
generating terrain. The resulting height array is exported to an SVG file.
After this test, I moved to Processing for better performance and simpler
interactivity and graphics rendering.
